Adib's HackPad - Firmware

This has a few things for the firmware, this includes:

- 9 switches (use for them will be later mentioned)
- OLED screen
- Rotary Encoder

The 9 switches are for each one of these stuffs:

0,0 Vol dow
0,1 Mute
0,2 Vol up
1,0 prev track
1,1 play/pause
1,2 forward track
2,0 ctrl c
2,1 ctrl v
2,2 ctrl x

The oled screen.

It displays the date, with automatic turn off after no keys are pressed for more then two minutes.
When the rotary dial is turned, the oled will switch to displaying volume and then returning back to date.

Rotary encoder, 

clockwise - vol up
anticlockwise - vol down
