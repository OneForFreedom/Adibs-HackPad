# Adib's HackPad

(Before you critisise anything, its my first time - juuustttt.. keep that in mind please lol.)
I took 30 or more hours on this, trust me.
I did this over the course of a week.
started doing the tutorial 1:1, then I realised that you wern't meant to follow it.
so I salvaged what was useable, and completely pissed my parents by spending 6pm to 12am just doing it after school over the course of the previous week.
last thursday (26/06/25 dd/mm/yy) I messed up by saving old versons of my PCB files, which ruined the project. so I had to redo it.
Luckily I had pictures of the schematic which let me redo that pretty easily, and the pcb was the hard bit, but got it in about 7 hours after realising that I had saved sketches in my CAD editor (Fusion)
I went through all 5 stages of grief in 20 seconds

Btw it took me soo long because the concept of a PCB was alien to me.

Now since my sob story's done. lets get to the facts:

This is a 3x3 Key Matrix style MacoPad with a 0.91 inch I2C type oled (the highlight of the pain of my journey) and a rotary encoder for volume.
